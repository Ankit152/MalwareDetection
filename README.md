# Malware Detection üîç 

`A Machine Learning approach to detect Malwares in the system.`

## Malware üëæ

Malware is malicious software that was intentionally developed to infiltrate or damage a computer system without consent of the owner. This includes, among others, viruses, worms, and Trojan horses.

Shorthand for malicious software, malware typically consists of code developed by cyberattackers, designed to cause extensive damage to data and systems or to gain unauthorized access to a network.

## Malware detection and Removal üïµÔ∏è

Malware detection refers to the process of detecting the presence of malware on a host system or of distinguishing whether a specific program is malicious or benign.

Here I have performed many Machine Learning Algorithm so that I can check which algorithm is performing better on classifying whether a specific program is malicious or not.

## Logistic Regression Performance
The Logistic Regression model gave an `accuracy` of `98%` which is really good. This is my first cut solution for detecting Malwares.

## Gradient Boosting Performance
The Gradient Boosting model performed much better than Logistic Regression and gave an `accuracy` of `98.88%`.

## MLP Classifier Performance
The MLP Classifier model gave an `accuracy` of `99%` which is better than Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting.

## Decision Tree Performance
The Decision Tree model gave an `accuracy` of `99.04%` which is slightly better than MLP Classifier but not any drastic increase in performance.

## Random Forest Performance üíØ
The Random Forest model performed the best!! It gave an `accuarcy` of `99.54%`. It is my fianl solution.

`The best model and the scaler is saved and present in the asset folder. Do give it a try.`
